# Case Study: Application Log Monitoring Using ELK Stack in Docker

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to build a system for monitoring and processing logs from a Python application using the **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and containerizing the entire solution using **Docker**. With this setup, I was able to collect logs in real-time, analyze them, and visualize them using Kibana. The project was designed with the goal of monitoring production applications, making it easier to troubleshoot and respond quickly to failures.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: Used to containerize all components of the ELK stack and the log-generating application.
- **Elasticsearch**: Used for storing and indexing logs.
- **Logstash**: Responsible for collecting logs and forwarding them to Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana**: Provided an interface for visualizing and analyzing the logs.
- **Python**: Used to create an application that generated random logs at different levels.
- **Docker Compose**: Used to orchestrate and manage the containers for all project components.

## Project Goal

The aim was to create a system that could collect logs from an application, centralize them in Elasticsearch, and visualize them using Kibana. This solution allowed me to:
- Monitor applications in real-time.
- Simplify log analysis and error identification.
- Implement a system for proactive problem detection.

## Project Implementation Steps

### 1. Installing Docker and Docker Compose

The first step was installing Docker and Docker Compose on the local machine, which enabled me to run and manage containers, including Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and the Python application generating logs. Docker Compose allowed for simultaneous startup of all these containers.

### 2. Creating Docker Compose Configuration

Next, I prepared the `docker-compose.yml` file, which defined services for all components. Elasticsearch was configured as a single node, Logstash handled log processing and sent them to Elasticsearch, and Kibana provided an interface for viewing and visualizing those logs. Additionally, the Python application was added as a separate container to generate random logs.

### 3. Logstash Configuration

I configured Logstash to collect logs from the application via a TCP port and forward them to Elasticsearch, where they were indexed. This allowed me to monitor in real-time whether the application was working correctly and detect any potential issues.

### 4. Log-Generating Python Application

I created a simple Python application that generated random logs at different levels, such as `INFO`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, and `DEBUG`, every 5 seconds. The logs were saved in local files and collected by Logstash before being forwarded to Elasticsearch.

### 5. System Startup

All containers were started using the `docker-compose up` command. Elasticsearch started functioning as the log storage engine, Logstash collected logs from the Python application, and Kibana provided log visualization.

### 6. Log Monitoring and Analysis in Kibana

Once Kibana was up and running, I navigated to the **Discover** tab, where I could easily browse and analyze the logs generated by the application. Kibana allowed me to create visualizations that made it easier to identify potential problems, such as failed connections or network errors.

### 7. Customizing Dashboards in Kibana

Finally, I customized dashboards in Kibana, creating charts and visualizations based on the collected log data. This allowed me to track which types of errors occurred most frequently and which applications generated the most problematic logs. This greatly facilitated diagnosing and resolving issues in the application.

## Conclusions

Through this project, I learned how to use Docker for container management and the ELK Stack for application log monitoring. The solution proved to be highly effective in monitoring applications in real-time, which is crucial in production environments. Visualizing logs in Kibana allowed me to respond quickly to issues and prevent potential failures.
